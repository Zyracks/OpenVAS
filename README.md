Version: 4.0.5 (corresponds to OpenVAS-9) Virtual machine

Download the virtual machine at:
http://dl.greenbone.net/download/VM/gsm_ce_4.0.5.iso

Fire it up and follow the instructions, when you come to a message that says you need to do "Update feed"
then go to "Maintenance --> Feed --> Update" The feed takes a long time to update, and it shows no progress bar
so just wait it out.

NOTE: You need internet access to do the feed update, and you can't use the machine without the update.

In case you need SSH access, go to "Setup --> Services --> SSH --> Enable"

Command line Interface (CLI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CLI can be accsess via SSH or serial port.

All changes in the settings that are being performed in the CLI are not activated immediately. As soon as 
a setting is changed in the CLI the prompt changes and indicates that there is an unsaved change. 
An asterisk at the prompt indicates a change that is not activated yet.
"commit" or "rollback" allows the decision between accepting or reverting of a change.

In addition the get command shows if a variable is currently "get" This is indicated with 
an "s" at the beginning of the line. A "u" indicates that the variable currently is not set. 
Clearing of a variable is possible with the command "unset" Variables can be configured with "set"
